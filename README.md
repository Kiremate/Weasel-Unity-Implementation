# Dawkins' Weasel Program in Unity

## Description
The Dawkins' Weasel program is a simulation demonstrating the power of cumulative selection, as originally outlined by Richard Dawkins in his book "The Blind Watchmaker." This Unity-based implementation allows users to visualize the process by which random mutations can lead to complex forms through non-random, cumulative selection.

## Features

- **Random Mutation:** Introduces random mutations in offspring.
- **Cumulative Selection:** Selects the best-fit candidates for each generation.
- **Visual Interface:** Unity-based graphical interface to watch the evolution happen in real-time.
- **Statistics:** View statistics like generations passed, best candidate, etc.

## How to Use

1. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start" button to initiate the simulation.
2. **Pause**: You can pause the simulation to closely examine the current state.
3. **Reset**: Reset the simulation to its initial state.
4. **View Statistics**: Click on the "Stats" button to view detailed metrics.
